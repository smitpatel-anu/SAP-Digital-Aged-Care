## SAP Digital Aged Care

Digital Aged Care is now an innovation platform for aged care providers to help people continue living independently in their homes. We use artificial intelligence on data from sensors, devices and other applications to predict risk, mobilise the care team and give visibility to the family.
We are working with support from the office of the Federal Minister of Aged Care, Google, Samsung and Apple to make this a reality. And, pilots are beginning in Queensland, Fukushima Japan and Bangalore India.

The Android Wear app will be able to collect data from the Samsung Galaxy Watch via Samsung Health, including Heart Rate, Steps and Sleep. Now, after our learnings, we want to build more intuitive capability on an android wear device, such as a fossil watch.
Features developed for this project include:
* Sending data without a phone (4g)
* Parkinson tremor monitoring
* GPS location tracking
* Improved battery life
* Detect new data
* Fall Detection
